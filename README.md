#Minimalistic Wordle clone

Only pure JS/HTML/CSS, no dependencies, no prettier/linter, without even any
build process.

The largest file (excluding dictionaries) is game.js 250 loc.

It was challenging to write code without ignoring habits like splitting code
into separate files, designing with future features in mind, or just using 
the basics of BEM. Despite this, the code is quite good (just feel some shame
about CSS).
